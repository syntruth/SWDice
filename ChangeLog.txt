* Fixed a small return type issue in SWDie.m

2012-1-5
* Updated all the files to be ARC-compliant. This means that this
  code will now only work with XCode 4+. 

2011-12-15
* Subclassed SWDie from SWDice and moved some of the singular die
  logic into this class, such as getDie: and getDieAsString: etc.
* Added half value methods to SWDie to handle stuff such as doing
  Fighting/2 + 2 for the Parry derived trait.
* Still very beta at the moment; haven't tested this and will need
  to do so for iOS 5. I suspect that I'm gonna have to disable ARC
  for this lib, or else convert it all to XCode 4 compliant code, 
  removing any retain/release/autorelease clauses.

* Moved the body of SWRollResult -process into the default initializer
  since it seemed silly to have a separate method for it that is only
  ever called once.
* Changed SWDice -dieString to -asString.

2011-09-08
* Cleaned up the code to conform to the "standard" style guides, as well
  as commented the code finally.
* Added -rollAgainstTaretNumber to SWDice.
* Changed params to -rollWithMod:againstTargetNumber: to be NSInteger and
  NSUInteger, respectively.
* Added -dieString to SWDice class, which returns the die/dice represented
  by an instance in xdx[+/-x] format.
* Added -tallyAsString to SWRollResult class, which returns the roll tally
  as a string, joined by commas.
* Added this change log file! :D
